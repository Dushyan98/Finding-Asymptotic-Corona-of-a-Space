By using this code we can find all filters, ultra filters, closed ultra filters, and asymptotic corona of a discrete space.
When we try to work for 5 elements we have to compute more than 4 billion combinations, thus we cannot a proper visualization of filters.
When it comes 6 element we need to compute 2^64 combinations. Which results in a computational disaster.
